# 🧮 Beginner-Friendly Java Calculators

This repository showcases two simple Java programs perfect for beginners:
- A **Basic Calculator** for fundamental arithmetic operations.
- A **Scientific Calculator** that includes additional features like square root and safe division with error handling.

These calculators are built using **core Java concepts** such as:
- `Scanner` for input
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Looping constructs
- Exception handling

They run in the terminal and help new programmers understand how to build menu-driven applications and handle user input in Java.

> 🧠 Ideal for first-year computer science students or anyone getting started with Java.
